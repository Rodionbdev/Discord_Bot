# 🛡️ Discord Moderation Bot

**Alfredo_2033** is a powerful and customizable Discord moderation bot built using [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus).  
It is designed to help manage communities by providing essential moderation tools such as warnings, mutes, bans, and user status checks. Ideal for small to mid-sized servers.

## ✨ Features

- `/warn` — Issue a warning to a user  
- `/unwarn` — Remove a warning  
- `/checkwarns` — View a user's warning count  
- `/mutechat` / `/unmutechat` — Mute/unmute users in text channels  
- `/mutevoice` / `/unmutevoice` — Mute/unmute users in voice channels  
- `/ban`, `/kick`, `/unban` — User management commands  
- `/rules` — Display server rules  
- `/info` — Display bot info  
- Automatic punishments:
  - 3 warnings = chat mute  
  - 5 warnings = ban

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)  
- A Discord Bot Token  
- Roles `MutedFromChat` and `MutedFromVoice` are auto-created on startup  

## 🚀 Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rodionbdev/Discord_Bot.git
